#Domain of the Problem

The data in this project is on Abalone the data set can be found here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/abalone. The research aims to predict the age of abalone from its physical measurements. 

#Problem Statement

To predicte the age of the abalone it there is a lot of preparation which needs to be done. The abalone must cut through the shell, stained with a dye, then the number of rings must be counted using a microscope. In addition to the this feature data collected weather data, and location data maybe used. 
#Dataset Description
The dataset is Multivariate, it contains 4,177 instances, with 9 attributes. 

#Solution 

To reach a solution we are using regression and using predictor variables with outcome variables. 

#Benchmark Model

For our benchmark we will use a na√Øve model. 
 
#Performance Metric

The use of Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) will be used for this regression problem.
